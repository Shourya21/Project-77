            With Visual Studio IDE, users are provided live coding assistance regardless of the programming language they are utilizing. The platformâ€™s built-in IntelliSense offers hints and descriptions of APIs and auto-completes lines for better speed.

Additionally, Visual Studio IDE ensures that developers do not lose their last modification place as they explore the rest of their code.

            Console
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Web Console Logs information associated with a web page, for eg: network requests, JavaScript, CSS, security errors and warnings as well as error, warning and informational messages explicitly logged by JavaScript code running in the page context. JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac) or Cmd +Shift +J (on Windows).

As an alternative, you could right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect," and the developers window will appear. Click the "Console" tab in that window.
        </p>

        <p>
            We use the console.log() method to print to console Javascript.
